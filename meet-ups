# Organising our meet-ups 👩‍💻👨‍💻

##### It's really important that everyone who comes to our meet-ups leaves feeling like they've learned something and are excited to keep working hard at cracking code!

### So to do that we've come together with a few top tips:

1. Introduce yourself to every person who walks through the door
2. tell them where the toilets are!
3. Even when people are settled start asking if you can help, if anyone has any questions.
4. Try and remember names and introduce people to one another to encourage pair working
